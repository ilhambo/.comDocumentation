#Deployment.com uses a deployment model that relies on Git, Kudu, and Courier to move your changes from one environment to another.  .com uses a classic "left to right" deployment model, meaning that changes are first made in the development environment, then deployed to the staging environment, then deployed to the live environment.  Note:  not all projects have a staging environment, so your deployment may be from development to live.##How do I deploy?In general to deploy a site to umbraco.com after you’ve made changes to a local clone is as simple as doing a Git Push from your local Git client.  Umbraco keeps track of all the changes you make to as site and includes these changes when you deploy.  Of course, once you’ve deployed your local changes to your dev site on umbraco.com deploying to your staging or your live site is literally as simple a pressing a button.##I’m ready to get started, what do I do first?From the umbraco.com portal [www.umbraco.io](www.umbraco.io) copy your dev site’s HTTPS Clone Url and then clone the site using your favorite Git client.  We like SourceTree and will use that in this example.  Here are the steps to clone your site:1. Copy the HTTPS Clone Url from the portal for your dev site2. From SourceTree select Clone/New and paste the Url in the Source Path box3. Set your Destination Path to where you keep your local work4. You’ll be prompted to log in, use the same credentials as you did for the portal5. Click CloneNow you have an exact copy of your dev site locally.  We like to use Microsoft WebMatrix when working locally, but you can use Visual Studio or another development tool.  When you run your local site for the first time you’ll notice that umbraco updates the site.  Wait until this process completes as it also creates the local Sql CE database for your site.Once your local site is running, any additions you make will be picked up by umbraco.  This includes umbraco items like document types and also items like CSS file you add and even your own custom dll’s.Once you have your local site just how you want it you’ll Git Commit the changes you’ve made and Git Push them to your umbraco.com site for deployment.  We’ll do this using SourceTree again.1. In SourceTree review the File Status tab and Stage all files by checking the box.  2. You can unstage any files in /app_data/TEMP/ , /app_data/umbraco.sdf, /app_data/umbraco.config, and other temporary files you may be using.3. Select Commit and enter a commit message4. Click the Commit button5. Now select the Push option - which will have a number (of commits) displayed6. Make sure you have the master branch selected (this is the only one that will get deployed) and click the OK button7. You may wish to check the Show All Output box so that all messages from your site are displayed8. Once the push and deployment is complete you will see a Deployment Successful message in the output window9. Congratulations!  You just did a remote site deployment.Now, when you login to your dev site you’ll notice all the items you created locally are present.  You can review these updates, and make more as needed.  When you’re ready to deploy your live site, you only need to use the Deploy to Live option from the umbraco.com portal.
