#Welcome to Umbraco.com
While we’re getting your new Umbraco site ready why don’t you take a minute and read through our getting started tips.  If you’ve used Umbraco before you’re already ready to go as Umbraco-as-a-Service _is_ Umbraco.  If you’ve never used Umbraco before we’ve got some tips to help you get started.  Finally, if you’re ready to step up from the Trial version of Umbraco and start using the full power of Umbraco-as-a-Service, head over to the Subscriptions area of this portal and select the Umbraco version that’s right for you.

###What's up with the name umbraco.com?
Since umbraco.com _is_ Umbraco we thought we'd stick with a name that describes what it is.  So there you go.  We also like to call it just ".com".

## Projects and Sites
In umbraco.com we organize your work into projects which are made of sites, teams, settings, and other related resources like databases and file storage.  In a Trial project you have just one site with a team of one.  But with an Agency project you have three sites (development, staging, live), a team of many, and other items.  But always you start with a project and then, depending on what you want to do, you'll use a site from that project.

For developers, you will use the development site to create and test your code.  You may even clone the development site to your local machine to work there and then, once things are just how you like, push you changes to the development site.  See more about this in the [deployment section](/deployment/index.md).

For content editors, you will either use the staging site or the live site to create and edit your content.  There is a case to be made for both of these, read on to find out why you may or may not want to author content in your staging environment.

##Finding your Umbraco Project
Well now, that should be easy.  To navigate to your site, simply log in to the user portal [www.umbraco.io](http://www.umbraco.io) and then click on Projects then the project you want to use.

We create your site’s Url using the name you used when you created the site, then we add _umbraco.io_.  So your site’s Url will look something like _snoopy.umbraco.io_ and your site’s Umbraco back office Url will look something like _snoopy.umbraco.io/umbraco_.

##Logging in to Umbraco
With the Trial version of umbraco.com you need to log in to work with the Umbraco back office and also to view your site.  The user name and password for both locations are the same as the user name and password you use for the portal.  Once you upgrade to any of the non-Trial versions you’ll no longer need to login to view your live site but, of course, will still need to log in to the back office.

From your site’s management dashboard select the “Umbraco Back Office” link to login to the back office and the “Browse Website” link to view your site.

##About the default Umbraco Starter Kit
Your Trial umbraco.com project already has a website set up for you, we call this the Starter Kit.  We’ve taken the liberty of adding the Starter Kit to help give you an idea of how an Umbraco site is put together.  Feel free to tinker with the content and other bits to see what happens.  We don’t expect you to leave the content as-is, so let your creative side out and do something fun.
 
##Making changes to your site
This is where you get to make your Umbraco site your own.  Umbraco is built using web standards - things like Html, css, and JavaScript.  You’ll find the Html that makes up the Templates for your site in the Settings section, under the Templates tree.  This is plain-old-html, so feel free to change or replace what’s there.  The same goes for your site’s Css (it’s in the Stylesheets tree) and the JavaScript (yup, in the Scripts tree).
