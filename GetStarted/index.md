#Welcome to Umbraco .com
While we’re getting your new Umbraco site ready why don’t you take a minute and read through our getting started tips.  If you’ve used Umbraco before you’re already ready to go as Umbraco-as-a-Service _is_ Umbraco.  If you’ve never used Umbraco before we’ve got some tips to help you get started.  Finally, if you’re ready to step up from the Trial version of Umbraco and start using the full power of Umbraco-as-a-Service, head over to the Subscriptions area of this portal and select the Umbraco version that’s right for you.

##Finding your Umbraco site
Well now, that should be easy.  To navigate to your site, simply log in to this portal and then click on either the Site or Umbraco link under your site’s dashboard

We create your site’s Url using the name you used when you created the site, then we add umbraco.io.  So your site’s Url will look something like snoopy.umbraco.io and your site’s Umbraco back office Url will look something like snoopy.umbraco.io/umbraco

##Logging in to Umbraco
With the Trial version of Umbraco you need to log in to work with the Umbraco back office and also to view your site.  The user name and password for both locations are the same as the user name and password you use for this portal.  Once you upgrade to any of the non-Trial versions you’ll no longer need to login to view your site but, of course, will still need to log in to the back office.

From your site’s management dashboard select the “Umbraco” link to login to the back office and the “site” link to view you site.

##About the default Umbraco Starter Kit
Your new Umbraco site already has a website set up for you, we call this the Starter Kit.  We’ve taken the liberty of adding the Starter Kit to help give you an idea of how an Umbraco site is put together.  Feel free to tinker with the content and other bits to see what happens.  We don’t expect you to leave the content as-is, so let your creative side out and do something fun.
 
##Making changes to your site
This is where you get to make your Umbraco site your own.  Umbraco is built using web standards - things like Html, css, and JavaScript.  You’ll find the Html that makes up the Templates for your site in the Settings section, under the Views Tree.  This is plain-old-html, so feel free to change or replace what’s there.  The same goes for your site’s Css (it’s in the Stylesheets tree) and the JavaScript (yup, in the Scripts tree).
